Adjacency. C : it was fairly easy to get used to by following the 
numbering logic that is used for graphs and finding a formula to 
represent a location by it. The tricky part was analyzing the 
matrix which can be done fairly easily with other languages. 

edges.c : the hard part is to visualize graph as edges in mind and
treat them as number-pairs and manage them in an array. Also it is 
important to pass array in pointers form

bitops: it is important to understand the definition of "AND", "OR"
and "XOR". Traverse the characters in strings is a difficult point 
for this question.
